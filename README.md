# PracticalMachineLearningPA
This repository has all the files for the project assignment for "practical machine learning" class 

There are three files included: 

1. project.Rmd 

2. project.md 

3. project.html 

Somehow my gh-pages branch does not work as it suppose to be. 

You can just view the project.md file for grading!
Thanks!
